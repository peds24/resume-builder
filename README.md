## Profile JSON Structure

Your profile should follow this structure:

{
    "[tech skills]": "comma-separated technical skills",
    "[prof skills]": "comma-separated professional skills",
    "[jobs]": [
        {
            "header": "Job Title | Company | Location | Date",
            "description": [
                "Achievement 1",
                "Achievement 2"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "[projects]": [
        {
            "header": "Project Title, Role",
            "description": [
                "Project detail 1",
                "Project detail 2"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Template Setup

The resume generator works by finding specific section markers in your Word template and replacing them with content from your profile. To set up your template:

1. Create a new Word document or modify an existing one
2. Add the following section markers exactly as shown (including the square brackets):
   - `[tech skills]` - For technical skills
   - `[prof skills]` - For professional skills
   - `[jobs]` - For work experience
   - `[projects]` - For project experience
   - `[qualifications]` - This section is generated by the AI so make sure to include it in your template even though it is not on your profile.json

The generator will replace these markers with the corresponding content from your profile.json file. Currently, the AI model is trained to:
- Generate a list of qualifications
- Enhance and tailor skills to match job requirements
- Improve job and project descriptions

Place these markers where you want the content to appear in your resume. The formatting of the surrounding text will be preserved.
